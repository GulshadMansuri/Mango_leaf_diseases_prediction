# Problem Statement

Mango farmers face difficulty in identifying diseases on mango leaves at an early stage. Manual inspection requires expert knowledge, is time-consuming, and can lead to misdiagnosis. This affects crop quality, reduces yield, and increases losses.
The project aims to provide an automated and accurate system to detect mango leaf diseases using machine learning.

# Scope of the Project

- Build a web-based application for mango leaf disease detection.

- Accept leaf images uploaded by farmers.

- Use a trained machine-learning model to classify leaf diseases.

- Display disease name

# Target Users

- Farmers – who want quick and accurate disease detection.

- Agricultural officers – to assist in field diagnosis.

- Researchers / Students – to study plant disease classification.

- Agricultural businesses – interested in scalable farm-monitoring tools.

# High-Level Features

- Upload mango leaf image

- ML model predicts disease

- Shows disease name 

- Secure and easy-to-use interface
